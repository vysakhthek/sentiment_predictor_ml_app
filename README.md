# Text Sentiment Predictor APP

It's an app that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and determine the sentiment of any given text. Whether you want to gauge the sentiment of a social media post, customer review, news article, or any other piece of text, it provides accurate and reliable predictions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This app can also monitor and track app page usage and the predicted sentiment and probability of each text. It's built using Machine Learning-Natural Language Processing techniques and Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.

#### Used Libraries like:
- numpy, pandas for Data Analysis
- neattext for Data Cleaning
- altair, plotly and seaborn for Data Vizualization
- scikit-learn for Predictive Analysis
- streamlit to create custom web apps
- Joblib to provide lightweight pipelining

This app's model currently has an accuracy of around 70%. I'm currently working on improving the accuracy of the ML model
